# Reproducible-Data-Analysis-Project
Building Chicago Bulls team 
Description: In this scenario, I am a data analyst representing/working for NBA team Chicago Bulls which placed 27th out of 30 teams based on a win-loss record in the season 2018-19. We have a budget of $118 million for player contracts in the upcoming 2019-20 season where we ranked 26th out of 30 teams. My task as a data analyst is to use the budget in an effective manner which we can afford to identify the best five starting players for the team and that can be players that were already playing in Chicago Bulls team in 2018-19 season, of course proving that they are worth the investment.
  To tackle such a task, as a data analyst I must collect and analyze data on the performance as well as salaries of NBA players based on the previous season and use it to build a model that can help predict player performance. Based on the model we came up with, identify the top five players for each position our team can afford with the budget.
Overall, the vital goal is to improve team performance in the upcoming season having a budget constraint.
Summary of the project: As a data analyst, we were asked to provide and come up with 5 best and main players for the NBA team Chicago bulls for the 5 different positions (PG,SG,PF,SF,and C)and that to with a budget of $118 million. We were given data sets and information on basketball players based on their stats of the previous season which is 2018-2019 and need to come up with a prediction with the help of the data provided for the upcoming season.
For every data analyst, we begin by obtaining data and in our case was that of NBA players from the past season, then continue cleaning and replacing data from any missing values. Moreover, explore data and study any relation between the variables which proved that there was no relation or effect of age with salary and position. 
We continued by creating linear regression models for the 5 positions where we obtained a formula to help us impute the players stats to the formula for that position.
Concluded and finalized by choosing the following: 
#Stephen Curry with a salary 37457154 for point guard 
#Klay thompson with a salary 18988725 for shooting guard 
#Khris Middleton with a salary 1.3e+07 for shooting guard
#Julius Randlewith with a salary 8641000 for power forward 
#Nikola Vucevic with a salary 12750000 for Center  
#Total Salary of $ 90836879

All of the above was achieved with help by creating linear regression models for the different positions which then lead to getting a formula to be used to evaluate the players based on their stats.
